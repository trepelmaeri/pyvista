## What is Realistico?
 
Realistico is a resource pack created by Matteo Rizzo, a photographer and texture artist who also made Pastello, Minelands, and Bordercraft. Realistico aims to bring high-quality textures, materic shadows, and missing details to Minecraft while keeping the original feel of the game. It is compatible with most versions of Minecraft Java Edition, from 1.9 to 1.19.
 
Realistico uses advanced techniques such as POM (parallax occlusion mapping) and PBR (physically based rendering) to create realistic depth and lighting effects on the blocks. It also supports SEUS shaders, which are recommended for the best experience. Realistico makes Minecraft look like a completely different video game with its stunning visuals.
